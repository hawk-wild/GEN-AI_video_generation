======================================================================

For nearly a century, IIT Dhanbad has stood as one of India’s most iconic institutions. Founded in 1926 as the Indian School of Mines, the institute was envisioned by the British government following the recommendations of the McPherson Committee and modeled after the Royal School of Mines, London. Leaders like Lord Irwin, David Penman, and W.H. Berry played a key role in shaping its early foundations—laying the groundwork for an institution that would guide India’s mining and industrial future.

As we celebrate its centenary, the institute’s legacy shines brighter than ever—honoring a hundred years of excellence, resilience, and transformation.

Established in 1926 to meet India’s growing need for trained mining engineers, the institute quickly became the country’s premier center for mining education. The iconic Main Heritage Building, which has stood tall for decades, remains the heart of the campus—silent witness to generations of students, scholars, and leaders who walked its halls.

The journey from a specialized mining school to a comprehensive IIT is a story of remarkable evolution. In 1967, the institute was granted Deemed University Status, expanding its academic horizons far beyond mining. The historic conversion to IIT status in 2016 under the Institutes of Technology Act marked a new era—bringing in world-class programs, advanced research facilities, and students from across the nation through JEE Advanced.

Spread across 218 acres in Sardar Patel Nagar, the campus blends heritage with modernity. The Academic Complex, New Central Library, and Central Research Facility stand proudly alongside historic structures. Eleven hostels—named after precious gemstones like Diamond, Amber, and Jasper—are home to more than 6,000 students, creating a vibrant and diverse community.

With over 405 faculty members, IIT Dhanbad offers cutting-edge programs in Petroleum Engineering, Applied Geology, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and emerging interdisciplinary domains. Strong industry connections—especially with Coal India Limited and key energy sector organizations—ensure that research seamlessly translates into real-world impact. State-of-the-art laboratories and research centers lead innovation in mining safety, renewable energy, geosciences, and sustainable technologies.

Campus life is enriched by a thriving cultural and technical ecosystem. Concetto, the technical fest, and Srijan, the cultural extravaganza, bring together creativity, talent, and innovation. Numerous student clubs and organizations nurture leadership, community service, and lifelong friendships.

The institute’s alumni have shaped India’s industrial and scientific landscape. Among them is Jaswant Singh Gill, who led the heroic Raniganj coal mine rescue of 1989, saving 65 miners—an enduring symbol of courage and technical mastery. From leading national enterprises to building pioneering startups, IIT Dhanbad alumni continue to inspire future generations.

As the institute marks 100 years of excellence, IIT Dhanbad stands committed to honoring its heritage while embracing the challenges and opportunities of the future.
This is the legacy of an institution built on courage, knowledge, and an unyielding spirit of exploration—a beacon of technical education lighting the way for generations to come.
