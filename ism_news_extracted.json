From selling khaini (raw tobacco) at his father\u2019s small time shop in Nawada district, he has made it to the coveted civil services, the results of which were declared on Wednesday.\nBelonging to a small village, Pakri Barawan in Nawada district, 100 km south of Patna, Niranjan is not ashamed of his humble background.\n\u201cI used to sit at my father\u2019s small shop and sell khaini when he would go out. My father still runs the shop, even as I tell him he doesn\u2019t need to anymore for a monthly earning of Rs 5,000,\u201d says Niranjan.\nNiranjan remembers the struggles he had to overcome in life to achieve what he has.\n\u201cComing from a poor background, my father did not have enough money for the education of his children \u2013 three sons and a daughter. I successfully took the written test for admission to the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Nawada, for the simple reason that education was free there,\u201d he recollects.\nHaving done his matriculation from Nawada in 2004, he moved to Science College, Patna, for his intermediate level education in 2006.\n\u201cEven to pay the tuition fee of Rs 1,200 for two years was not easy for me. I used to walk 8-10 kms every day for my coaching classes. Later, after one-and-a-half years, I bought a second hand bicycle with Rs 600, which I saved by imparting tuitions to children, while staying with my uncle in Patna to pursue my intermediate studies,\u201d he recalls.\nNiranjan went on to compete in IIT-ISM, Dhanbad for mining engineering course. He took an education loan of Rs 4 lakh from bank that he repaid after joining the Coal India Limited as an assistant engineer (mining) in 2011.\nMarried to Nupur Gupta, an illustrator and digital designer, with whom he fell in love with, they have a one-month old daughter, Shaanvi. His father, Arvind Kumar, 60 and mother, Yashoda Devi, 55 are proud of their son\u2019s achievement.\nNiranjan is not satisfied with his 728th rank in civil services. \u201cI will get Indian Revenue Service (he belongs to the OBC category), but will write the UPSC civil services exams next year again because my target is to make the IAS,\u201d he signs off.\nNiranjan is among the 35-odd from Bihar who have made the cut in the civil services-2016 exams. Six of them \u2014 Utsav Kaushal (14th rank) Somesh Kumar Upadhyay (34th), Prema Dikshit (57th), Soumya Jha (58th), Aarif Ehsaan (74th) and Shashi Prakash Singh (75th rank) are in top 100 in the list of 1099 successful candidates pan India."

      "text_content": "After Mission Mangal and Kesari, actor Akshay Kumar is on a new mission in his upcoming film, Mission Raniganj: The Great Bharat Rescue. He will be reprising the role of mining expert, Jaswant Singh Gill in the film, written by Vipul K Rawal and directed by Tinu Suresh Desai. The trailer of the film offered a glimpse into the real story of Gill rescuing 65 miners from a flooded mine in Raniganj, West Bengal.\nWhat makes the incident important? Why did people celebrate Gill after the rescue mission, and why did he win \u2018Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak\u2019 from the then President of India, Ramaswamy Venkataraman? The indianexpress.com explains.\nBorn in Amritsar in 1940, Jaswant Singh Gill studied at Khalsa School and later took admission in BSc (non-medical) at Khalsa College (Amritsar). He studied BSc (Honours) from the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, before joining Coal India Limited in 1973. Throughout his tenure, he kept growing in ranks from 1-9 and ultimately retired in 1998 as Engineer-in-chief. The most significant event of his over two-decade career was the rescue mission at the Mahabir Colliery, Raniganj, West Bengal. He saved the lives of 65 miners who were trapped in a flooded coal mine. He also got the moniker of Capsule Gill after the incident.\nOn November 13, 1989, 232 miners were employed in the night shift to work towards the rise-most area of the 320-foot-deep mine to excavate coal through explosions. At around 4 am, there was a sudden influx of water, and the mine got flooded. The 161 miners who were near the two lifts in the pit could be rescued immediately, but 71 of them were far off and couldn\u2019t reach the lift due to the water. Fortunately, there was a telephone connection between the borehole and the surface, through which a message was sent that 65 miners had taken shelter at a rise part of the pit, but six of them had gone missing.\nOn learning about the trapped miners, the authorities formed four teams to rescue them. Three out of the four teams started trying various methods to bring out the miners. Several submersible pumps were inserted in the mine to reduce the water level, but the water kept recirculating inside the mine and the pumped-out water was finding its way back through cracks in the surface. Meanwhile, the oxygen level in the mine was depleting too, and the mine could collapse at any time.\nSenior engineer Jasawant Gill, who was a part of the fourth team, came up with an idea that nobody could have imagined. \u201cMy father started to innovate on a theoretical idea that had never been put to practical use. It involved fabricating a steel capsule about 7 feet high and 22 inches in diameter, creating a new borehole to lower the capsule into the mine and taking out the miners, one by one,\u201d Sarpreet Singh Gill, son of Jaswant Gill, shared with The Tribune.\nThe steel capsule was constructed in 72 hours and after a few trial runs up and down the borehole, rescue of men began on November 16 at 2.30 am. Gill insisted on going into the capsule himself to bring out the trapped men. After initial opposition from the top officials of Coal India Limited, Gill entered the capsule and brought out all of the 65 men one by one by 8:30 am. Initially, it took 15 minutes for one round trip of the capsule. So, a 12-tonne crane was put into service for lowering and raising the capsule and this reduced the cycle time to just 3 minutes.\nThere were 20,000 people who gathered to witness the rescue operation in Raniganj. \u201cIt took me six hours to bring up the 65 miners one by one and last of all, when I emerged from the capsule, people went mad with joy,\u201d Gill once shared with The Tribune. He added that the moment he came out, people lifted him on his shoulders and put garlands around his neck.\nHow was Jaswant Singh Gill rewarded for his act of bravery?\nTo celebrate Gill\u2019s act of bravery, Coal India Ltd announced November 16 as \u2018Rescue Day\u2019. Limca Book of Records has certified this operation as a national record in the history of coal mining.\nGill was also honoured with the highest civilian bravery award, \u2018Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak\u2019 by President Ramaswamy Venkataraman in 1991.\nUntil his death in 2019, Gill remained active in his social welfare work.\nClick here to follow Screen Digital on YouTube and stay updated with the latest from the world of cinema.\nThe Law Commission has determined that the simultaneous elections Bills are constitutional and do not need state ratification.

In 1996-97, the Indian government took over the control of the institute. On September 6, 2016, the Indian School of Mines (ISM) became the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad.\nIn 1956, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany offered assistance to establish a higher technological institute in India. It resulted in the signing of the first Indo-German Agreement in Bonn in 1959 to establish IIT Madras. The Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by professor Humayun Kabir, then Union Minister for Scientific and Cultural Affairs.\nIIT Delhi was established as College of Engineering in 1961 and later declared as an Institution of National Importance under the \u2018Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 1963\u2019 and renamed as IIT Delhi. IIT Delhi is a collaboration with the Government of the UK. The then Indian government negotiated with the British government to set up IIT Delhi.\nEstablished in 1958, it was the second IIT in the country.

      "text_content": "After Mission Mangal and Kesari, actor Akshay Kumar is on a new mission in his upcoming film, Mission Raniganj: The Great Bharat Rescue. He will be reprising the role of mining expert, Jaswant Singh Gill in the film, written by Vipul K Rawal and directed by Tinu Suresh Desai. The trailer of the film offered a glimpse into the real story of Gill rescuing 65 miners from a flooded mine in Raniganj, West Bengal.\nWhat makes the incident important? Why did people celebrate Gill after the rescue mission, and why did he win \u2018Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak\u2019 from the then President of India, Ramaswamy Venkataraman? The indianexpress.com explains.\nBorn in Amritsar in 1940, Jaswant Singh Gill studied at Khalsa School and later took admission in BSc (non-medical) at Khalsa College (Amritsar). He studied BSc (Honours) from the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, before joining Coal India Limited in 1973. Throughout his tenure, he kept growing in ranks from 1-9 and ultimately retired in 1998 as Engineer-in-chief. The most significant event of his over two-decade career was the rescue mission at the Mahabir Colliery, Raniganj, West Bengal. He saved the lives of 65 miners who were trapped in a flooded coal mine. He also got the moniker of Capsule Gill after the incident.\nOn November 13, 1989, 232 miners were employed in the night shift to work towards the rise-most area of the 320-foot-deep mine to excavate coal through explosions. At around 4 am, there was a sudden influx of water, and the mine got flooded. The 161 miners who were near the two lifts in the pit could be rescued immediately, but 71 of them were far off and couldn\u2019t reach the lift due to the water. Fortunately, there was a telephone connection between the borehole and the surface, through which a message was sent that 65 miners had taken shelter at a rise part of the pit, but six of them had gone missing.\nOn learning about the trapped miners, the authorities formed four teams to rescue them. Three out of the four teams started trying various methods to bring out the miners. Several submersible pumps were inserted in the mine to reduce the water level, but the water kept recirculating inside the mine and the pumped-out water was finding its way back through cracks in the surface. Meanwhile, the oxygen level in the mine was depleting too, and the mine could collapse at any time.\nSenior engineer Jasawant Gill, who was a part of the fourth team, came up with an idea that nobody could have imagined. \u201cMy father started to innovate on a theoretical idea that had never been put to practical use. It involved fabricating a steel capsule about 7 feet high and 22 inches in diameter, creating a new borehole to lower the capsule into the mine and taking out the miners, one by one,\u201d Sarpreet Singh Gill, son of Jaswant Gill, shared with The Tribune.\nThe steel capsule was constructed in 72 hours and after a few trial runs up and down the borehole, rescue of men began on November 16 at 2.30 am. Gill insisted on going into the capsule himself to bring out the trapped men. After initial opposition from the top officials of Coal India Limited, Gill entered the capsule and brought out all of the 65 men one by one by 8:30 am. Initially, it took 15 minutes for one round trip of the capsule. So, a 12-tonne crane was put into service for lowering and raising the capsule and this reduced the cycle time to just 3 minutes.\nThere were 20,000 people who gathered to witness the rescue operation in Raniganj. \u201cIt took me six hours to bring up the 65 miners one by one and last of all, when I emerged from the capsule, people went mad with joy,\u201d Gill once shared with The Tribune. He added that the moment he came out, people lifted him on his shoulders and put garlands around his neck.\nHow was Jaswant Singh Gill rewarded for his act of bravery?\nTo celebrate Gill\u2019s act of bravery, Coal India Ltd announced November 16 as \u2018Rescue Day\u2019. Limca Book of Records has certified this operation as a national record in the history of coal mining.\nGill was also honoured with the highest civilian bravery award, \u2018Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak\u2019 by President Ramaswamy Venkataraman in 1991.\nUntil his death in 2019, Gill remained active in his social welfare work.\nClick here to follow Screen Digital on YouTube and stay updated with the latest from the world of cinema.\nThe Law Commission has determined that the simultaneous elections Bills are constitutional and do not need state ratification.

He pursued his engineering in Mining Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology ISM Dhanbad. 1965 Batch, Mining Engineering. Gill, whose passing occurred on November 26, 2019, made a substantial contribution to the rescue efforts during the 1989 incident in Raniganj, West Bengal when miners were trapped inside a flooded coal mine.\nOn November 23, 1989, in Raniganj, West Bengal, 220 miners were engaged in their routine task of excavating coal through controlled explosions. Unfortunately, the region was experiencing severe flooding at the time. In an unfortunate accident, someone inadvertently disturbed the upper layer of the mine, leading to a sudden influx of water.\nWhile a significant number of workers successfully evacuated the mine using two lifts, 71 miners found themselves trapped as the mine shafts became inundated with water. Tragically, six individuals lost their lives in the incident, leaving 65 miners trapped underground.\nDuring that period, Jaswant Singh Gill held the position of additional chief mining engineer at the mine. Upon learning of the tragic situation where 65 lives were hanging in the balance, Jaswant Gill acted swiftly and without hesitation. He ventured into the borewell and undertook the remarkable task of rescuing the trapped miners single-handedly.\nHe took charge of the entire rescue operation, devising a strategic plan that included the ingenious concept of constructing a steel capsule capable of transporting one person at a time through the borewell.\nJaswant Singh Gill's extraordinary act of valor elevated him to the status of a national hero. In recognition of his selfless heroism, then-President of India, Ramaswamy Venkataraman, bestowed upon him the prestigious 'Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak' in 1991. Furthermore, in honor of his bravery and dedication, a square on Majitha Road in Punjab was dedicated and named after him.\nAnd now, Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar is all set to launch his upcoming film, \"Mission Raniganj,\" which is centered on the Raniganj Coalfields collapse of 1989."
